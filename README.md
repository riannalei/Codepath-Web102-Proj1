## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I encountered a lot of challenges while building the app since it was my first time using React. The first problem I encountered was why did I have to make separate JSX files when in HTML I could just put everything in the same file. I was also really confused with the syntax and made numerous mistakes. I also had a big issue with committing my project to GitHub and using Git as well.
